# **docker-challenges**

Repository created for solving challenges of the Docker course.

## **Challenge 1**

You will have to publish an image on Docker Hub. When we run:

docker run `<your-user>/fullcycle`

We should have the following output: Full Cycle Rocks!!

If you notice, this image just prints a message as the final result, so it's worth checking out the Go Lang website to learn how to make a "Hello, world" program.

Remember that Go Lang has ready-to-use official images, so it's worth checking the Docker Hub.

Our Go project image needs to be less than 2MB =)

### **Solution**

Run

```
nascito/fullcycle
```
